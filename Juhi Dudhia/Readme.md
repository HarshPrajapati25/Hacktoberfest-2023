- ## Q. Exploratory Testing Techniques: Discuss advanced strategies and best practices for exploratory testing, including mind mapping, session-based testing, and heuristics.

**Introduction**

In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, testing is a critical phase to ensure the quality and reliability of the final product. While traditional testing methods like manual and automated testing are essential, exploratory testing is gaining popularity due to its flexibility and ability to uncover hidden defects and issues that automated testing might miss. In this blog post, we'll delve into advanced strategies and best practices for exploratory testing, including mind mapping, session-based testing, and heuristics.

**Exploratory Testing Overview**

Exploratory testing is an approach that focuses on the tester's creativity, domain knowledge, and experience to uncover defects in software applications. Unlike scripted testing, which follows predefined test cases, exploratory testing encourages testers to explore the software, learn about it on the fly, and adapt their testing approach as they go. Advanced techniques and best practices can enhance the effectiveness of exploratory testing.
